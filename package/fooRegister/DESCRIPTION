Title: Demo Calling C or Fortran from R
Author: Charles J. Geyer <charlie@stat.umn.edu>
Maintainer: Charles J. Geyer <charlie@stat.umn.edu>
Depends: R (>= 3.0.2)
Description: This is a demo package for statistical computing classes
    that illustrates calling C or Fortran from R (using the R functions
    .C and .Call and .Fortran) and also calling R random number generators
    from that C or Fortran.  Unlike package foo, this also illustrates
    registration (Writing R Extensions
    <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html>,
    Sections 5.4 and 6.16).  Otherwise, everything
    is the same as package foo, mutatis mutandis (actually nearly every file
    in the package has some change, doing "diff -r foo fooRegister" is
    informative).
